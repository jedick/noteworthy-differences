## Noteworthy Changes (True)

These changes introduce essential, previously unstated, or fundamentally altered information that directly impacts the core identity, primary function, or crucial biographical/historical understanding of the subject. Such changes are considerably less frequent than "Not Noteworthy" changes.

*   **Core Factual Additions for Individuals:**
    *   Adding significant biographical details such as nationality, a significant previously unstated occupation (e.g., 'barrister'), specific physical attributes (e.g., height), or crucial career statistics (e.g., matches played).
    *   Adding precise birth and death dates (month and day) when only the year was previously stated.
    *   Adding specific publication years for a person's works.
    *   Adding significant biographical details about a person's major achievements or financial standing (e.g., "made a fortune with X company").
    *   Updating a person's current status that reflects a fundamental change in their role (e.g., from 'footballer' to 'former footballer') or adding a crucial detail like a specific playing position.
*   **Core Factual Additions for Entities/Concepts:**
    *   Adding primary, widely recognized identifiers that significantly enhance utility (e.g., an airport's IATA code).
    *   Adding crucial linguistic context, surname variations, or archaic spellings that fundamentally expand the core definition of a term or name.
    *   Adding significant factual information about a group's accomplishments or historical impact (e.g., specific policies, social spending, poverty reduction).
    *   Adding significant contextual information about a work's themes, purpose, or fundamental significance (e.g., its status as a debut film, core thematic elements).
    *   Adding practical information (e.g., explicit time zone explanations, formatting conventions for schedules) that significantly enhances the interpretability or usability of core data.
*   **Core Factual Corrections & Clarifications:**
    *   Correcting or clarifying specific names of historical bodies to improve factual accuracy at a fundamental level (e.g., "Constituent Assembly" to "National Constituent Assembly").
*   **Significant Removals:**
    *   Removal of a widely used common name for a subject (even if a scientific or primary identifier remains).
    *   Removal of specific historical data (e.g., an entity's IOC country code, number of appearances in an event, or debut year).

## Not Noteworthy Changes (False)

These changes are typically minor stylistic adjustments, rephrasing, additions of easily inferable or minor contextual details, or information that, while adding depth, does not alter the fundamental understanding or core identity of the subject. This category represents the majority (approximately 69%) of revisions according to human preferences.

*   **Minor Details & Rephrasing:**
    *   Minor stylistic corrections, grammar adjustments, capitalization changes, or punctuation changes.
    *   Rephrasing, structural reorganization, or moving content that does not introduce new fundamental information or alter the core meaning.
    *   Adding specific examples, anecdotes, or detailed explanations that deepen understanding but do not change the fundamental nature or core conclusion of a concept or definition.
    *   Removing an adjective that describes an achievement (e.g., "award-winning").
    *   Removing a specific detail about literary output if the core biographical details remain largely intact (e.g., "never yet a novel").
    *   Removing an alternative name or specific sub-location detail (e.g., county) if the primary identifier and broader location (city, state) are still present.
    *   Removing alternative spellings from a disambiguation page.
    *   Adding or removing specific duration details for episodes or minor formatting elements of a series description.
    *   Adding related names for context that do not fundamentally alter the definition or core identity of the primary subject.
*   **Inferable Information & Minor Specificity:**
    *   Adding information that is highly inferable or readily implied from existing text or context (e.g., adding "of the Union" when context is American Civil War, or "United States" when "West Virginia" is mentioned).
    *   Adding minor geographical specificity (e.g., a sub-district within a district) or a fuller competition name that is implicitly understood or a minor detail.
    *   Adding specific tenure dates when the start and end dates are already explicitly stated or easily inferable elsewhere in the article.
*   **Cultural & Linguistic Information (Generally False):**
    *   Adding any form of pronunciation (e.g., IPA, romanization, Latin American Spanish pronunciation).
    *   Adding names or scripts in indigenous, native, or other foreign languages (e.g., Hebrew script, Chinese characters, Persian name, Hungarian name) or their literal translations.
    *   Adding alternative official names (e.g., "Banqiao Night Market", common English name for a building, scientific binomial name in Latin) for places, entities, or concepts.
    *   Fixing broken language templates or clarifying official names/abbreviations (e.g., political party names) unless it involves a *core factual correction of a historical body's name* (which is noteworthy).
*   **Corrections & Updates (Generally False):**
    *   Correction of units for a quantifiable trait (e.g., 'cm' to 'mm').
    *   Adding fundamental biological characteristics (e.g., "diurnal" activity pattern).
    *   Adding record-breaking characteristics or superlatives (e.g., "largest member of X family").
    *   Direct factual correction of a major collaborating institution's name or expansion of an institution's stated scope.
*   **Administrative & Format Changes:**
    *   Replacing templates with equivalent content, changing abbreviations, or repositioning references without altering factual content or meaning.
    *   Minor formatting adjustments (e.g., hyphens, spaces in date ranges) that do not alter factual content or meaning.
