## Noteworthy Changes (True)

**Factual Additions/Corrections:**
- Adding significant biographical details (birth year, occupations, cultural names). This includes quantifiable traits like height or blood type.
- Updating population data to be significantly more current (5+ years).
- Adding record-breaking characteristics or superlatives relevant to the article subject.
- Inserting important geographical features (coastal location, landlocked status when not obvious).
- Including cultural/historical context that wasn't inferable (nicknames with meaning, generational impact, direct quotes revealing significant personal preference).
- Adding specific dates for events or tenures that were previously undated or only broadly described.

**Tone & Neutrality:**
- Removing vandalism or inappropriate language that destroys article neutrality.
- Correcting words that radically alter tone (e.g., "lucky" when referring to deaths).

**Substantive Content Changes:**
- Altering the framing of historical events (different causes or contexts presented).
- Adding causes or factors to complex events (mass displacement, additional contributing factors).
- Expanding definitions to include **new significant categories or fundamental variations** (e.g., four-door coupes, multiple pronunciations, entirely new types of an object).
- Adding **new or significantly altered** technical/scientific explanations for key properties or phenomena (vs. adding depth or nuance to existing explanations).
- Removal of explicit lists of components (e.g., list of schools in a district) that define a subject's fundamental structure.
- Significant factual updates to a subject's current status (e.g., changing 'plays for' to 'played in' and specifying league for a player).

**Cultural Recognition:**
- Including indigenous language names/scripts that honor cultural background.
- Adding alternative official names (Latin, other languages) for historical agreements or places.
- Adding native language pronunciation (e.g., IPA or romanization) when previously absent or incorrect/broken template.

## Not Noteworthy Changes (False)

**Minor Details:**
- Grammatical adjustments, rephrasing, or structural reorganization. This includes minor grammatical corrections that may incidentally imply a factual update, but the core meaning remains clear (e.g., 'formally' to 'formerly', 'was' to 'is' when the status is broadly understood or easily inferable).
- Adding locality specificity within already-stated regions (sub-district within district, specific county within a known state/country).
- Adding nicknames without significant cultural/historical weight.
- Word choice refinements that don't change fundamental meaning or fundamentally alter the subject's core identity or role (e.g., "locals" → "Indigenous people" as terminology update only; "fashion model" to "supermodel and activist"; "large" to "coeducational"; clarifying a 'brook' is a 'river' when its nature is implicit).
- Removing specific birth/death *locations* (city, state/province) if the broader nationality or region is known or implied, and if no other essential geographical information about the person's origin or demise is lost.
- Removal of alternative names or lesser-known designations if the primary identifier remains and the core identity is unaffected.
- Adding official subtitles or taglines for media (e.g., TV season subtitles), which serve as additional identifiers rather than core content.
- Adding an item to an existing, general list of types or instances if it doesn't represent a significant new category or a major increase in scope (e.g., adding one more country to a long list, one more hit song to an existing list, 'rapid transit' to railway types if the article broadly covers railway types).
- Adding specific ordinal numbers (e.g., '60th governor', 'sixteenth album') or precise dates for tenures/events that are already generally known or broadly described.
- Adding etymological meanings or detailed historical anecdotes/origins for names/terms if their primary identity and context are already established and the addition does not introduce new fundamental understanding or change the article's core narrative.
- Adding relational context or familial prominence (e.g., 'disciple of X', 'member of prominent family') if it doesn't introduce specific new achievements, roles, or a fundamental shift in the subject's identity directly attributable to that relationship.
- Adding universally known dates to major events already mentioned (e.g., "1485" for the Battle of Bosworth).

**Inferable Information:**
- Details implied by other information (e.g., "landlocked" when no coastal borders mentioned).
- Ancestry relationships that explain omitted technical details.
- Generalizing a location from a specific city to a broader country, when both are known/implied and no new specific information or clarification is provided.

**Depth vs. Substance:**
- Deeper analysis that doesn't change fundamental conclusions.
- Additional technical details that provide nuance but not new fundamental understanding or mechanism for a concept.
- Clarifications of already-conveyed information.
- Minor statistical updates that don't represent significant temporal gaps.
- Adding specific criteria or detailed definitions that deepen understanding of an existing concept but do not change its fundamental nature or core conclusion.

**Administrative/Format Changes:**
- Order changes in lists.
- Removal of extraneous text or typos (unless they substantially affected meaning).
- Template replacements with equivalent content (unless fixing a broken template that rendered information inaccessible).

## Key Principles

1.  **Inferability Test**: If the new information could be reasonably inferred from the old revision, or if it generalizes already specific information without adding new insight, it's likely not noteworthy.
2.  **Completeness vs. Depth**: Adding information that makes an entry more complete by introducing **new core facts** (e.g., a previously missing occupation, birth year, specific height/blood type, adding a previously missing indigenous script) is noteworthy. Adding **deeper analysis, minor specificity, or additional context** to existing information without changing fundamental conclusions usually isn't.
3.  **Context Matters**: The same change can be noteworthy or not depending on article context (longest year trivia is noteworthy on a year's own page).
4.  **Temporal Significance**: Updates spanning 5+ years are noteworthy; minor year-to-year updates typically aren't.
5.  **Framing Changes**: Alterations to how events or subjects are presented or understood at a fundamental, definitional level are noteworthy; descriptive upgrades or rewordings that preserve core meaning are not.
6.  **Cultural Respect**: Additions recognizing cultural identity, indigenous languages, or heritage (e.g., native scripts, pronunciations, meaningful cultural names) are noteworthy.
